# Machina Emblematica
This repository contains the source code of Machina Emblematica. The Machina is a simple state of the art Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system prototype that makes the digital 1668 edition of Joachim Camerarius’ [Symbola et Emblemata](https://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/en/details/bsb10575861) more accessible and explorable. The goal was to create an innovative, user-friendly chatbot prototype that enables users to ask questions about the emblems and search for related contents in the Symbola et Emblemata. Machina Emblematica innovates access and exploration of the 17th century Latin emblems by providing an assistant that generates user query responses in English based on the most relevant multimodal content retrieved. The prototype advances existing solutions from projects enhancing accessibility and exploration of historical images and texts.

Let the Machina guide you through the world of Symbola et Emblemata. The prototype can be tested here: [https://machina.rainersimon.io](https://machina.rainersimon.io).
